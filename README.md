- 🔭 I'm learning programming and scripting to better ground myself in Cybersecurity and DevOps
- 💻 I currently use [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/TurboYetiii) and [PentesterLab](https://pentesterlab.com/profile/YetiLike) for practical learning of Cybersec concepts; as well as any other resources I am able to access
- I use Github to keep me accountable and adapt what I've learned into real-world processes and practices.
- I hope to be able to reach a point where I can actively contribute to the wonderful world of open-source ✨.

  - **Being a better scripter/programmer**: Any resources or tips that have helped you on your journey would be greatly appreciated!
  - **Help with Unix and Bash**: Still getting used to the environment and syntax for Unix. I'm working towards the Linux Essentials Certification but any other tips would be a massive help.
  - **Collaboration**: Collaboration can sometimes substitute for not having a mentor in these spaces. I'm happy to work on projects to help me improve coding and security practices.
  - **Good books!**: I like to read in my downtime so appreciate any book recommendations you may have. 😁
